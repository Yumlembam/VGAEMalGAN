# VGAEMalGAN

1.Run run.py test-project and extract API graph <br/>
2.Run Graph Neural Network.ipynb to extract embedding <br />
3.Run Machinelearning alogrithm inside machine learning folder to get machine learning results <br />
4.Run VGAEMalGAN to generate adverserial API graph a)GAN-VAE.ipynb when graph sage is black box model b) GAN-VAE-CNN when CNN+GraphSage is black box model
